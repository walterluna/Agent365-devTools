<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Creates and fully configures a Microsoft Entra Agent ID / Agent 365 agent identity blueprint
    using ONLY Microsoft Graph REST API calls. Does not use the Agent 365 CLI.

.DESCRIPTION
    Performs the complete blueprint provisioning sequence:

      1. Connect to Microsoft Graph as an application (client credentials) or as a user.
      2. Resolve sponsor / owner principals to directory object IDs.
      3. Resolve requested permission names to their scope / app-role GUIDs on each resource app.
      4. POST   /applications/microsoft.graph.agentIdentityBlueprint          (create blueprint)
         POST   /applications/{id}/microsoft.graph.agentIdentityBlueprint/owners/$ref   (assign owners)
      5. POST   /applications/{id}/microsoft.graph.agentIdentityBlueprint/federatedIdentityCredentials
         or POST /applications/{id}/microsoft.graph.agentIdentityBlueprint/addPassword (dev-only secret)
      6. PATCH  /applications/{id}/microsoft.graph.agentIdentityBlueprint     (identifierUris + exposed
                                                                              scope + requiredResourceAccess)
      7. POST   /servicePrincipals/microsoft.graph.agentIdentityBlueprintPrincipal
         POST   /servicePrincipals/{id}/microsoft.graph.agentIdentityBlueprintPrincipal/owners/$ref
      8. POST   /applications/microsoft.graph.agentIdentityBlueprint/{id}/inheritablePermissions
      9. POST   /oauth2PermissionGrants  +  /servicePrincipals/{id}/appRoleAssignments   (admin consent)

    Every call is issued through Invoke-MgGraphRequest so the wire request is a literal Graph REST call.
    The script is re-runnable: existing objects are detected and reused rather than duplicated.

    AUTHENTICATION
    The script is built to run unattended as an application. Pass -ClientId together with one of
    -ClientSecret, -CertificateThumbprint, -Certificate or -CertificatePath, or use
    -UseManagedIdentity / -AccessToken. In that mode permissions come from Microsoft Graph
    APPLICATION app roles granted to the app registration - delegated scopes are neither requested
    nor honoured - and the script verifies up front that every role it needs is actually granted.
    Use New-A365AutomationApp.ps1 to create that app registration.

    To sign in as a human instead, pass -Interactive. An authentication method must be chosen
    explicitly so an unattended run can never silently block on a sign-in prompt.

    Application (app role) permissions required on Microsoft Graph:
        AgentIdentityBlueprint.Create               AgentIdentityBlueprintPrincipal.Create
        AgentIdentityBlueprint.Read.All             AgentIdentityBlueprintPrincipal.Read.All
        AgentIdentityBlueprint.ReadWrite.All        Application.Read.All
        AgentIdentityBlueprint.AddRemoveCreds.All   User.Read.All, Group.Read.All
    plus DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All and AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All when
    -GrantAdminConsent is used, and when -Owner is supplied:
        Application.ReadWrite.All  + Directory.Read.All        (owners on the APPLICATION)
        AgentIdentityBlueprintPrincipal.ReadWrite.All          (owners on the PRINCIPAL)
    Those two are not interchangeable - Application.ReadWrite.All does not authorize an owner
    write on the blueprint principal.

.PARAMETER TenantId
    The Entra ID tenant to operate against.

.PARAMETER ClientId
    Application (client) ID to authenticate as. Required for client secret and certificate auth,
    optional for a user-assigned managed identity or a custom -Interactive app.

.PARAMETER ClientSecret
    Client secret, as a SecureString or a plain string. May also be supplied through the A365_CLIENT_SECRET
    environment variable so it never appears in a command line or transcript.

.PARAMETER CertificateThumbprint
    Thumbprint of a certificate in the current user's or machine's certificate store.

.PARAMETER Certificate
    An already-loaded X509Certificate2 to authenticate with.

.PARAMETER CertificatePath
    Path to a .pfx file. Combine with -CertificatePassword when the file is protected.

.PARAMETER CertificatePassword
    Password for -CertificatePath, as a SecureString or a plain string.

.PARAMETER UseManagedIdentity
    Authenticate with the host's managed identity. Add -ClientId for a user-assigned identity.

.PARAMETER AccessToken
    A Microsoft Graph access token, as a SecureString or a plain string, for callers that mint
    tokens themselves.

.PARAMETER Interactive
    Sign in as a user with delegated scopes instead of running as an application.

.PARAMETER SkipPermissionCheck
    Skips the app role pre-flight check performed in app-only mode.

.PARAMETER DisplayName
    Display name of the agent identity blueprint. Also used as the idempotency key on re-run.

.PARAMETER Sponsor
    Sponsor UPN(s) or object ID(s). At least one is REQUIRED by the create API, which accepts a
    collection - verified against the live API, where two sponsors passed to sponsors@odata.bind
    both persisted. Users, dynamic-membership groups and Microsoft 365 groups are supported;
    security groups and role-assignable groups are not.

    Sponsors can only be set on the CREATE call, so re-running against an existing blueprint
    reconciles them separately through sponsors/$ref - verified live that this works delegated
    and that the added sponsor persists.

.PARAMETER Owner
    Optional owner UPN(s), service principal name(s) or object ID(s) to assign as blueprint owners.
    Owners are assigned through the dedicated owners/$ref collection on both the blueprint and its
    blueprint principal, so re-running the script repairs missing owners.
    Owners must be users or service principals - Entra ID rejects groups as application owners
    (unlike -Sponsor, which does accept Microsoft 365 and dynamic groups).

    An app registration has THREE different GUIDs and only one of them can own anything. If you
    pass an appId or an application object id, this script translates it to the app's service
    principal automatically and prints a note:
        appId ("Application (client) ID")   b2475fce-...   -> translated
        application object id               6b43a0b1-...   -> translated
        service principal object id         b28e3ca9-...   -> used as-is  <- the one owners/$ref wants
    Without that translation Entra ID answers with errors that name the GUID but never explain the
    mismatch: 404 Request_ResourceNotFound for an appId, and for an application object id
    400 "The reference target 'Application_<guid>' of type 'Application' is invalid for the
    'owners' reference."
    The principal that creates the blueprint is always added as an owner by Entra ID automatically.
    Owners can create and modify agent identities under the blueprint without an Agent ID role.

.PARAMETER RequireOwnerAssignment
    Treat a refused -Owner assignment as fatal instead of the default: a warning, with the
    blueprint otherwise left complete and usable.

.PARAMETER Description
    Description applied to the blueprint. Set on create; under -Update, sent only when passed
    and different from the current value.

.PARAMETER ManagedIdentityPrincipalId
    Principal (object) ID of a user-assigned managed identity to register as a federated identity
    credential. This is the recommended production credential.

.PARAMETER FederatedCredentialName
    Name of the federated identity credential created for -ManagedIdentityPrincipalId. Defaults
    to 'a365-managed-identity'. Also used to detect an already-registered credential on re-run.

.PARAMETER NewClientSecret
    Development only. Adds a client secret via addPassword and prints it once.

.PARAMETER ClientSecretLifetimeDays
    Lifetime, in days, of the secret created by -NewClientSecret (1-730, default 180). Also used
    as the Key Vault entry's expiry when -KeyVaultName is given.

.PARAMETER ExposedScopeValue
    Name of the delegated scope the blueprint exposes so an agent front end can call the agent
    back end (required for interactive / OBO agents). Defaults to 'access_agent'.
    Pass an empty string to skip exposing a scope.

.PARAMETER RequiredPermission
    Array of hashtables describing the APIs the agent needs, by permission NAME (GUIDs are resolved
    at run time from each resource service principal):

        @{ ResourceAppId = '<guid>'; DelegatedScopes = @('Name1'); AppRoles = @('Name2') }

.PARAMETER GrantAdminConsent
    Grants tenant-wide admin consent on the blueprint principal for every resolved permission.
    Required before agents minted from the blueprint receive scp / roles claims.

.PARAMETER SkipInheritablePermissions
    Skips step 8. By default the script marks every requested resource app as allAllowed so agent
    identities inherit the blueprint's grants without extra consent.

.PARAMETER OutputJsonPath
    Write a JSON summary of the run (tenant, ids, resources, admin-consent URLs and, when
    -NewClientSecret was used, the secret in PLAINTEXT). Treat the file as a credential when
    -NewClientSecret is combined with it.

.PARAMETER Update
    Update a blueprint that already exists instead of creating one. Requires -BlueprintId.

    Only the attributes supplied on the command line are written; anything omitted is left
    exactly as it is. -DisplayName and -Sponsor stop being mandatory in this mode.

    Update-A365Blueprint.ps1 is the dedicated entry point for this and is usually the clearer
    way to call it. Both run exactly the same code.

.PARAMETER BlueprintId
    With -Update, the blueprint to change. Accepts either the application (client) id or the
    object id; the script works out which it was given.

.PARAMETER KeyVaultName
    Save the new client secret to this Azure Key Vault instead of relying on the one-time
    console output. Accepts a vault name ("contoso-kv") or the full
    https://contoso-kv.vault.azure.net URI.

    Key Vault is NOT part of Microsoft Graph and cannot be: a Graph token presented to the
    vault is rejected with HTTP 401, because a token is bound to its audience. The write
    therefore goes to the Key Vault data plane on a second token for
    https://vault.azure.net, obtained from the SAME credential used for Graph.

    The caller needs a Key Vault DATA-plane role. Owner and Contributor are NOT enough -
    they carry no dataActions and cannot read or write secrets. Grant "Key Vault Secrets
    Officer" on the vault.

.PARAMETER KeyVaultSecretName
    Name to store the secret under. Defaults to the display name folded to the characters
    Key Vault allows (0-9, a-z, A-Z and '-'). Writing an existing name adds a new VERSION
    rather than overwriting, so history is preserved.

.PARAMETER KeyVaultAccessToken
    A bearer token for https://vault.azure.net, for the cases where one cannot be derived
    from the Graph credential: -AccessToken (a Graph token is audience-bound and cannot be
    exchanged) and -Interactive without a signed-in Azure session.

.PARAMETER LogPath
    Write a timestamped log of this run. A path that names an existing directory (or ends in
    a separator) gets a generated file name inside it; anything else is used as the exact
    file name. Omit it to log nothing.

.PARAMETER LogIncludeSecrets
    Allow plain-string client secrets and passwords in the log. SecureString values and bearer
    tokens remain redacted. Only meaningful with -LogPath.

.PARAMETER LogCorrelationId
    Correlation id written into the log, shared with any calling script's own log so a run can
    be traced across scripts. Generated automatically when omitted.

.EXAMPLE
    # Unattended, running as an application with a client secret from the environment.
    $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET = '<secret>'
    .\New-A365AgentBlueprint.ps1 -TenantId <tenant> -ClientId <automation-app-id> `
        -DisplayName 'Contoso Expense Agent' -Sponsor alice@contoso.com `
        -ManagedIdentityPrincipalId <mi-principal-id> -GrantAdminConsent

.EXAMPLE
    # Unattended, running as an application with a certificate.
    .\New-A365AgentBlueprint.ps1 -TenantId <tenant> -ClientId <automation-app-id> `
        -CertificateThumbprint A1B2C3... `
        -DisplayName 'Contoso Expense Agent' -Sponsor alice@contoso.com

.EXAMPLE
    # Signed in as a user instead of as an application.
    .\New-A365AgentBlueprint.ps1 -Interactive -TenantId <tenant> -DisplayName 'Dev Agent' `
        -Sponsor alice@contoso.com -NewClientSecret -WhatIf

.EXAMPLE
    # Assign owners alongside the sponsor. Re-running with a longer -Owner list adds only the
    # missing owners; existing owners are left untouched.
    .\New-A365AgentBlueprint.ps1 -TenantId <tenant> -ClientId <automation-app-id> `
        -DisplayName 'Contoso Expense Agent' `
        -Sponsor finance-team@contoso.com `
        -Owner alice@contoso.com, bob@contoso.com, 1511d5e7-c324-4362-ad4b-16c20076e5aa

.NOTES
    Requires PowerShell 7+ and the Microsoft.Graph.Authentication module (used purely as a token
    provider and REST transport).

# Logging (shared shape across the A365 suite)
#
# One log file per RUN, never appended to by another run: the name carries the date and
# the time to the second, plus a short random suffix so that two runs starting inside the
# same second cannot collide. Windows treats ':' as an alternate-data-stream separator and
# rejects it in a file name, so the time is written HH-mm-ss.
#
# Every line is flushed as it is written rather than buffered, so a log is complete up to
# the moment of a crash - which is exactly when it is worth having.
#
# SECRETS ARE REDACTED BY DEFAULT. -LogIncludeSecrets opts in to recording client secrets
# and passwords. BEARER TOKENS ARE ALWAYS REDACTED and there is deliberately no switch to
# include them: a captured token is replayable by anyone who reads the file until it
# expires, whereas a client secret at least implies possession of the app registration.
