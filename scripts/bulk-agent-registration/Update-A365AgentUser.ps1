.SYNOPSIS
    Updates an existing Microsoft Agent 365 agent user, writing only the attributes supplied.

.DESCRIPTION
    A dedicated entry point for changing an agent user that already exists, so updating is a
    separate, explicit command rather than a flag on the create script.

    ONLY THE ATTRIBUTES YOU PASS ARE WRITTEN. This matters more here than anywhere else in
    the suite: on the create path -UsageLocation defaults to US and -DisplayName is derived
    from the user principal name, so forwarding on "has a value" rather than "was supplied"
    would silently rewrite a live account on every run. Nothing is forwarded unless it was
    bound on the command line.

    The update refuses to touch an account that is not an agent user, so an ordinary
    employee's account cannot be modified by mistake.

    The user principal name cannot be changed after creation and is therefore not accepted
    here; the account is identified by -AgentUserId instead.

    APP-ONLY AUTHENTICATION ONLY. New-A365AgentUser.ps1 has no -Interactive and no
    -SkipPermissionCheck, so those parameters are deliberately absent from this script too
    rather than being accepted and then failing downstream.

    The Graph work itself is done by New-A365AgentUser.ps1, which this script invokes in its
    update mode. That script reports failure by exiting with a non-zero code instead of
    throwing, so this script checks the exit code - a try/catch alone never fires.

.PARAMETER AgentUserId
    Object id or user principal name of the agent user to update.

.PARAMETER DisplayName
    New display name.

.PARAMETER MailNickname
    New mail nickname.

.PARAMETER UsageLocation
    Two-letter usage location. Only written when supplied; it is NOT defaulted here, because
    defaulting it would overwrite the stored value on every update.

.PARAMETER ManagerUserId
    Object id of the manager to assign. Mutually exclusive with -ManagerUpn.

.PARAMETER ManagerUpn
    User principal name of the manager to assign. Mutually exclusive with -ManagerUserId.

.PARAMETER AssignLicense
    Assign a licence. Needs -LicenseSkuId or -LicenseSkuPartNumber, and the account must have
    a usage location either already set or supplied in the same run.

.PARAMETER LicenseSkuId
    SKU id of the licence to assign.

.PARAMETER LicenseSkuPartNumber
    SKU part number of the licence to assign, for example MICROSOFT_AGENT_365_TIER_3.

.PARAMETER DisabledPlans
    Service plan ids to disable within the assigned licence.

.PARAMETER TenantId
    Directory (tenant) ID or verified domain.

.PARAMETER ClientId
    Application (client) ID to authenticate as. Forwarded unchanged to
    New-A365AgentUser.ps1, which is app-only - see its help for the full authentication
    reference.

.PARAMETER ClientSecret
    Client secret, forwarded unchanged. Accepts a string or a SecureString - the exact
    object handed in is the exact object New-A365AgentUser.ps1 receives, never re-typed,
    copied or stringified along the way.

.PARAMETER CertificateThumbprint
    Thumbprint of a certificate in the -CertificateStoreLocation store, forwarded unchanged.

.PARAMETER CertificateStoreLocation
    Store to read -CertificateThumbprint from: 'CurrentUser' or 'LocalMachine', forwarded
    unchanged.

.PARAMETER Certificate
    An X509Certificate2 to authenticate with, forwarded unchanged.

.PARAMETER CertificatePath
    Path to a .pfx file, forwarded unchanged.

.PARAMETER CertificatePassword
    Password for -CertificatePath. Accepts a string or a SecureString and is forwarded
    unchanged, for the same reason as -ClientSecret above.

.PARAMETER UseManagedIdentity
    Authenticate with the host's managed identity, forwarded unchanged.

.PARAMETER ManagedIdentityClientId
    Client id of a user-assigned managed identity, forwarded unchanged.

.PARAMETER AccessToken
    A pre-acquired Graph access token. Accepts a string or a SecureString and is forwarded
    unchanged, for the same reason as -ClientSecret above.

.PARAMETER StepParameter
    Escape hatch: a hashtable splatted into New-A365AgentUser.ps1 for parameters this wrapper
    does not surface. Keys are the step script's own parameter names and must not include
    'Update', 'AgentUserId', 'TenantId' or 'UserPrincipalName' - the first three are already
    supplied by this script, and the UPN cannot be changed after creation.

.PARAMETER ScriptRoot
    Directory containing New-A365AgentUser.ps1, which performs the actual Graph work.
    Defaults to this script's own directory - keep the two files together, or pass this
    explicitly.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Update-A365AgentUser.ps1 -TenantId $tid -ClientId $app -ClientSecret $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET `
        -AgentUserId 'research.assistant@contoso.com' -DisplayName 'Research Assistant'

    Rename the account. The usage location and manager are not passed, so they are not written.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Update-A365AgentUser.ps1 -TenantId $tid -ClientId $app -ClientSecret $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET `
        -AgentUserId $id -AssignLicense -LicenseSkuPartNumber MICROSOFT_AGENT_365_TIER_3

    Assign a licence to an agent user that already has a usage location.

.NOTES
    Requires New-A365AgentUser.ps1 beside this script, and app-only authentication.
