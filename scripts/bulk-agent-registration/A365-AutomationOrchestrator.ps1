.SYNOPSIS
    Provisions a complete Microsoft Agent 365 agent: blueprint, agent identity, registry
    registration and optionally an agent user, in one pass, using only Microsoft Graph.

.DESCRIPTION
    Orchestrates the scripts that make up the A365 provisioning pipeline:

        1. New-A365AgentBlueprint.ps1      the blueprint application + its principal
        2. New-A365AgentIdentity.ps1       an agent identity created from that blueprint
        3. New-A365AgentRegistration.ps1   the agent's entry in the Agent 365 registry
        4. New-A365AgentUser.ps1           the agent user bound to that identity

    Nothing is reimplemented here - the step scripts remain the single source of truth and
    are invoked as-is, so their idempotency, retry and permission pre-flight behaviour all
    still apply. Re-running after a partial failure is safe: existing objects are reused
    rather than duplicated.

    SAY WHAT YOU WANT CREATED

    Each scenario has its own switch. Nothing runs unless you ask for it:

        -NewBlueprint          the blueprint application and its principal
        -NewAgentIdentity      an agent identity under a blueprint
        -NewAgentRegistration  the registry entry for an agent identity
        -NewAgentUser          the agent user (a real, licensable directory object)

    Combine them freely. The whole pipeline is:

        -NewBlueprint -NewAgentIdentity -NewAgentRegistration

    SAY WHERE TO START WHEN YOU ARE NOT CREATING THE WHOLE CHAIN

    A create needs a parent. Normally the parent comes from an earlier phase of the same run,
    and nothing extra is needed. When the parent already exists, name it:

        -UseExistingBlueprint    <appId>     build the identity on this blueprint
        -UseExistingAgentIdentity         <objectId>  create the agent user under this identity
        -UseExistingAgentIdentity <objectId>     create the agent user under, and/or
                                                 register, this identity

    Each is an attribute of the phase that needs it, exactly like -BlueprintDisplayName or
    -AgentIdentitySponsor. Each is refused alongside any action in the same run that would
    produce that same parent, so a run can never both create and reuse the same object.

    Every phase therefore has exactly one stated source. Nothing is inferred from which ids
    happen to be present.

    CHANGING SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS

    Each object has an update parameter that TAKES THE ID of the object to change, so an
    update names its own target:

        -UpdateBlueprint         <blueprint appId or objectId>
        -UpdateAgentIdentity     <agent identity objectId>
        -UpdateAgentUser         <agent user objectId or UPN>
        -UpdateAgentRegistration <registration id, starts with T_>

    ONLY THE ATTRIBUTES YOU SPECIFY ARE WRITTEN. A parameter you leave off the command line
    is not forwarded at all, so it cannot overwrite what is already stored - including
    parameters that have a default value on the create path, such as -AgentUserUsageLocation.
    That is the whole contract of update mode, and it is enforced by forwarding on
    "was this parameter bound", never on "does this variable have a value".

    -NewX and -UpdateX are mutually exclusive for the same object: a single run either
    creates it or changes it. Update parameters can be combined across objects, so one run can
    update the blueprint, the identity and the registration together.

    An update is also a source for the phases below it. -UpdateBlueprint <id> -NewAgentIdentity
    builds the new identity on the blueprint phase 1 just acted on, with no second id needed.

    To change a single object, there is also a dedicated script per object, which takes the
    same attribute names without the scenario prefix:

        Update-A365Blueprint.ps1          -BlueprintId
        Update-A365AgentIdentity.ps1      -AgentIdentityId
        Update-A365AgentUser.ps1          -AgentUserId
        Update-A365AgentRegistration.ps1  -RegistrationId

    Those scripts and this one run exactly the same code, so pick whichever reads better: this
    orchestrator when a run touches several objects, the dedicated script when it touches one.

    A few merge semantics are worth knowing before you rely on them. Graph replaces a collection
    it is sent, but the step scripts do not always send one, so the behaviour you actually get is:

        custom security attributes  merge per attribute - untouched attributes survive, but a
                                    multi-valued attribute that is written is replaced wholesale
        tags (agent identity)       merge - the script reads the current set and PATCHes the
                                    union, so re-running to add one tag does not drop the others
        owners (agent identity)     additive - existing owners are skipped, new ones are POSTed
                                    to owners/$ref, so nothing already assigned is removed
        ownerIds (registration)     replaces the whole collection - list every owner to keep

    DELETING SOMETHING

    Each object also has a removal parameter that takes the id of the object to delete:

        -RemoveAgentRegistration <T_id>      the admin-center inventory entry
        -RemoveAgentUser         <objectId>  the agent user (mailbox and UPN)
        -RemoveAgentIdentity     <objectId>  the agent identity
        -RemoveBlueprint         <appId>     the blueprint, shared by every identity under it

    Removal runs AFTER any create or update phases in the same run, and in REVERSE dependency
    order - registration, then agent user, then agent identity, then blueprint. Deleting a
    parent first would orphan its children; the agent user especially, because it is discovered
    through its identity.

    Deletion is a SOFT delete: objects move to deleted items and are restorable for 30 days.
    -RemovePermanent purges them, which is irreversible. -RemoveInspectOnly reports the full
    plan and deletes nothing, and is the right first command every time.

    -RemoveBlueprint refuses while any agent identity still exists under the blueprint, because
    the blueprint is shared; -RemoveForce cascades instead.

    Removing an object is mutually exclusive with creating or updating that same object.

    WHAT DEPENDS ON WHAT

        -NewAgentIdentity      needs -NewBlueprint, -UpdateBlueprint or -UseExistingBlueprint
        -NewAgentRegistration  needs -NewAgentIdentity, -UpdateAgentIdentity or -UseExistingAgentIdentity
        -NewAgentUser          needs -NewAgentIdentity, -UpdateAgentIdentity or -UseExistingAgentIdentity

    Agent user and registration are siblings, not a chain: both need only the agent
    identity, so an agent user failure does not stop the registration being created.

    Parameters belonging to a scenario you did not select are reported as ignored rather
    than silently doing nothing.

    ONE PARAMETER, ONE OBJECT

    -TenantId is the only setting shared by every scenario. Everything else names the object
    it configures, so no parameter ever fans out to more than one phase and nothing is
    derived from a shared base name. Where two phases need the same value - an owner, say -
    give it to each of them.

.PARAMETER NewBlueprint
    Create the blueprint application and its blueprint principal (phase 1).

    Every setting for this phase is prefixed -Blueprint*: -BlueprintDisplayName (required),
    -BlueprintSponsor (required), -BlueprintDescription, -BlueprintOwner,
    -BlueprintRequireOwnerAssignment, -BlueprintRequiredPermission,
    -BlueprintGrantAdminConsent, -BlueprintSkipInheritablePermissions,
    -BlueprintNewClientSecret, -BlueprintManagedIdentityPrincipalId and
    -BlueprintParameter.

.PARAMETER NewAgentIdentity
    Create an agent identity (phase 2). Needs -NewBlueprint, -UpdateBlueprint or
    -UseExistingBlueprint.

    Every setting for this phase is prefixed -AgentIdentity*: -AgentIdentityDisplayName
    (required), -AgentIdentitySponsor (required), -AgentIdentityOwner,
    -AgentIdentityRequireOwnerAssignment, -AgentIdentityTag,
    -AgentIdentityCustomSecurityAttribute, -AgentIdentityRequiredPermission,
    -AgentIdentityGrantAdminConsent and -AgentIdentityParameter.


.PARAMETER NewAgentRegistration
    Register the agent in the Agent 365 registry (phase 4). Needs -NewAgentIdentity,
    -UpdateAgentIdentity or -UseExistingAgentIdentity.

    Every setting for this phase is prefixed -AgentRegistration*:
    -AgentRegistrationDisplayName, -AgentRegistrationDescription, -AgentRegistrationOwner,
    -AgentRegistrationAuth, -AgentRegistrationOwnerId and -AgentRegistrationParameter.


.PARAMETER NewAgentUser
    Create the agent user bound to the agent identity (phase 3). Needs -NewAgentIdentity,
    -UpdateAgentIdentity or -UseExistingAgentIdentity.

    This creates a real directory object that can hold a licence and a mailbox, so it is
    never implied by any other switch.

    Every setting for this phase is prefixed -AgentUser*: -AgentUserPrincipalName
    (required), -AgentUserDisplayName, -AgentUserMailNickname, -AgentUserManagerUserId,
    -AgentUserManagerUpn, -AgentUserUsageLocation, -AgentUserAssignLicense,
    -AgentUserLicenseSkuId, -AgentUserLicenseSkuPartNumber and -AgentUserParameter.

    There is no -AgentUserSponsor, -AgentUserOwner or -AgentUserDescription because
    New-A365AgentUser.ps1 accepts none of them; an agent user takes its sponsorship from the
    identity it is created under.

    Requires AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All. User.ReadWrite.All does NOT authorize it.


.PARAMETER UseExistingBlueprint
    AppId of a blueprint that already exists, to create the agent identity under. Only needed
    when the blueprint is not part of this run: with -NewBlueprint or -UpdateBlueprint the id
    threads through automatically, and passing it as well is refused.

.PARAMETER UseExistingAgentIdentity
    Object id (the service principal id) of an agent identity that already exists, to create
    the agent user under and/or to register. Only needed when the identity is not part of this
    run.

    One parameter serves both phases, so a single run can create the agent user and the
    registration for the same existing identity without naming it twice.

.PARAMETER AgentRegistrationIdentityId
    Re-points an EXISTING registration at a different agent identity, with
    -UpdateAgentRegistration. That is a value being changed, not a parent being reused, which
    is why it keeps its own name.

    To register an agent identity that already exists, use -UseExistingAgentIdentity instead;
    one parameter then serves both the agent user and the registration phase in the same run.
    On a -NewAgentRegistration run this parameter is still accepted and means the same thing,
    but supplying both with different ids is refused rather than silently resolved.

.PARAMETER UpdateBlueprint
    Update the blueprint with this id (phase 1). Accepts either the application (client) id
    or the object id.

    ONLY the attributes you actually pass on the command line are written. A -Blueprint*
    parameter you leave out is not sent at all, so it cannot overwrite what is already
    there. Pass -BlueprintDisplayName, -BlueprintDescription, -BlueprintSponsor,
    -BlueprintOwner, -BlueprintRequiredPermission and so on to change just those.

    The blueprint this names is also the one a -NewAgentIdentity in the same run builds on.

    Cannot be combined with -NewBlueprint: an object is either created or updated in a
    single run.

.PARAMETER UpdateAgentIdentity
    Update the agent identity with this object id (phase 2).

    Only the -AgentIdentity* attributes you pass are written. Typical uses are renaming
    (-AgentIdentityDisplayName), retagging (-AgentIdentityTag) and changing custom security
    attributes (-AgentIdentityCustomSecurityAttribute).

    Custom security attributes merge per attribute. Tags are added to an order-preserving,
    case-insensitive union with the identity's existing non-inherited tags; existing tags are
    not removed.

    The identity this names is also the one a -NewAgentUser or -NewAgentRegistration in the
    same run acts on.

    Cannot be combined with -NewAgentIdentity.

.PARAMETER UpdateAgentUser
    Update the agent user with this object id or user principal name (phase 3).

    Only the -AgentUser* attributes you pass are written. -AgentUserUsageLocation defaults
    to US on create, so it is deliberately NOT sent on an update unless you pass it
    explicitly; otherwise every update would silently rewrite the account's usage location.

    -AgentUserPrincipalName is rejected here: the UPN cannot be changed after creation, and
    the account is identified by -UpdateAgentUser itself.

    Like -NewAgentUser this requires app-only authentication.

    Cannot be combined with -NewAgentUser.

.PARAMETER UpdateAgentRegistration
    Update the agent registration with this id (phase 4). This is the id the SERVICE returned
    when the agent was registered - it starts with 'T_'. The service assigns that id itself
    and ignores any id supplied at creation time, so a client-generated GUID never resolves.
    Aliased as -UpdateRegistration.

    Only the -AgentRegistration* attributes you pass are written. -AgentRegistrationOwner
    and -AgentRegistrationOwnerId replace the whole ownerIds collection, so list every owner
    you want to keep; leaving both out preserves the existing owners rather than falling
    back to the signed-in user.

    Pass -AgentRegistrationIdentityId to re-point the registration at a different agent
    identity.

    The registration API reports a 200 on writes that do not stick, so the step script reads
    the object back and warns per property that failed to persist.

    Cannot be combined with -NewAgentRegistration.

.PARAMETER RemoveBlueprint
    DELETE the blueprint with this id (appId or objectId). The most destructive operation here:
    a blueprint is shared by every agent identity built from it.

    Refuses if any agent identity still exists under the blueprint, listing them and printing
    the command to remove them first. Add -RemoveForce to cascade instead, which deletes those
    identities and their agent users before the blueprint.

.PARAMETER RemoveAgentIdentity
    DELETE the agent identity with this object id, and nothing else. An agent user attached to
    it is reported but NOT deleted - remove it first with -RemoveAgentUser, in the same run.

.PARAMETER RemoveAgentUser
    DELETE the agent user with this object id. This destroys the agent's mailbox and releases
    its user principal name. The agent identity is left alone.

.PARAMETER RemoveAgentRegistration
    DELETE the registration with this id - the 'T_' prefixed id the service returned. This is
    what removes the agent from the Microsoft 365 admin center inventory.

.PARAMETER RemoveInspectOnly
    Resolve and report everything the removal phases would delete, then exit without deleting
    anything. Run this first: it is the cheapest way to discover that an object has dependents
    you did not know about.

.PARAMETER RemovePermanent
    After the soft delete, also purge from /directory/deletedItems. IRREVERSIBLE. Without it a
    deleted object is restorable for 30 days, and a deleted agent user still appears under
    deleted users in the admin center.


.PARAMETER RemoveForce
    Suppress confirmation prompts, and allow -RemoveBlueprint to cascade to the agent
    identities and agent users built from the blueprint. Required for unattended runs.

.PARAMETER TenantId
    Directory (tenant) ID or verified domain. The only parameter shared by all scenarios.

.PARAMETER BlueprintDisplayName
    Display name for the blueprint. Required with -NewBlueprint.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityDisplayName
    Display name for the agent identity. Required with -NewAgentIdentity.

.PARAMETER AgentRegistrationDisplayName
    Display name for the registration. Defaults to -AgentIdentityDisplayName when the
    identity is created in the same run; required when registering an existing identity.

    The registration script rewrites a trailing " Identity" to " Agent".

.PARAMETER BlueprintRequiredPermission
    Permissions declared on the blueprint, as an array of hashtables:

        @{ ResourceAppId = '<appId>'; DelegatedScopes = @('..'); AppRoles = @('..') }

    Supplying this REPLACES the blueprint script's defaults rather than adding to them.
    Omit it entirely to keep them.

    Pair it with -BlueprintGrantAdminConsent to consent the permissions as well as declare
    them.

.PARAMETER BlueprintGrantAdminConsent
    Consent the declared permissions on the blueprint principal, and enable inheritance so
    agent identities created from the blueprint receive them.

    This is the switch you almost always want. Its counterpart
    -AgentIdentityGrantAdminConsent means something quite different - see there.

.PARAMETER BlueprintSkipInheritablePermissions
    Declare and consent the permissions but do not make them inheritable. Agent identities
    created from this blueprint will not receive them.

.PARAMETER BlueprintSponsor
    Sponsor(s) for the blueprint. Required with -NewBlueprint. Accepts several: the create
    API takes a sponsors collection, verified against the live API where two sponsors both
    persisted.

    Pass users, Microsoft 365 groups or dynamic groups; static security groups and
    role-assignable groups are rejected by the service.

    Sponsors are set on the create call only. Re-running against an existing blueprint will not
    add sponsors to it.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentitySponsor
    Sponsor(s) for the agent identity. Required with -NewAgentIdentity. Accepts several,
    with the same accepted principal types as -BlueprintSponsor.

.PARAMETER BlueprintOwner
    Owners applied to the blueprint. See -AgentIdentityOwner for the accepted forms and the
    permissions an owner assignment needs.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityOwner
    Owners applied to the agent identity.

    Accepts object ids, UPNs, mail addresses or display names.

    To make an app an owner you may pass its appId, its application object id, or its service
    principal object id - steps 1 and 2 translate the first two to the service principal, which
    is the only one of the three that Entra ID accepts in an owners/$ref reference.

    Assigning an owner needs permissions wider than the AgentIdentity* roles the rest of the
    pipeline uses, and the target decides which one: the blueprint APPLICATION and the agent
    identity need Application.ReadWrite.All (or Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy) plus
    Directory.Read.All, while the blueprint PRINCIPAL needs
    AgentIdentityBlueprintPrincipal.ReadWrite.All. Application.ReadWrite.All does not cover the
    principal - verified against the live service. Delegated callers also need an Application
    Administrator or Cloud Application Administrator role. If the caller lacks them the owner
    writes are reported as warnings and the run continues, because the blueprint and identity are
    complete and usable without them.

.PARAMETER AgentRegistrationOwner
    Owners for the registration. Step 4 resolves them to user object ids through Graph and
    records them in the registration's ownerIds/createdBy, which is what lets the
    registration run app-only without a /me call. Owners that are not users are skipped.

.PARAMETER BlueprintRequireOwnerAssignment
    Treat a refused owner assignment on the blueprint as fatal instead of continuing with a
    warning.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityRequireOwnerAssignment
    Treat a refused owner assignment on the agent identity as fatal instead of continuing
    with a warning.

.PARAMETER BlueprintDescription
    Description applied to the blueprint.

.PARAMETER AgentRegistrationDescription
    Description recorded on the registration.

.PARAMETER AgentRegistrationOwnerId
    Object id recorded as the registration's owner. Optional: when it is omitted the
    registration step resolves the owners from -AgentRegistrationOwner through Graph, and
    falls back to the signed-in user when running delegated.

.PARAMETER AgentRegistrationAuth
    How the registration phase authenticates:
        Same         (default) reuse the credentials given to this script
        Interactive  sign in as a user for the registration phase only

    Both registration permissions ARE published as application roles
    (AgentRegistration.ReadWrite.All, AgentInstance.ReadWrite.All), so 'Same' works for an
    app-only run provided the automation app has been granted them and you pass
    -AgentRegistrationOwner or -AgentRegistrationOwnerId (there is no /me to read ownerIds
    and createdBy from). Use 'Interactive' only when the app lacks those roles.

    To not register at all, simply omit -NewAgentRegistration.

.PARAMETER BlueprintNewClientSecret
    Adds a client secret to the blueprint. Printed once, never written to -OutputJsonPath,
    unless -BlueprintKeyVaultName saves it to Azure Key Vault instead.
    Prefer -BlueprintManagedIdentityPrincipalId for anything that outlives a demo.

.PARAMETER BlueprintKeyVaultName
    Save the blueprint client secret to this Azure Key Vault rather than printing it once.
    Accepts a vault name or the full https://<vault>.vault.azure.net URI. Only meaningful
    with -BlueprintNewClientSecret, which is what creates a secret to save.

    Key Vault is not reachable through Microsoft Graph - a Graph token is rejected there
    with HTTP 401 - so the write uses the Key Vault data plane on a second token minted
    from the same credential. The caller needs the "Key Vault Secrets Officer" DATA-plane
    role; Owner and Contributor do NOT grant it.

.PARAMETER BlueprintKeyVaultSecretName
    Name to store the blueprint secret under. Defaults to the blueprint display name folded
    to the characters Key Vault allows.

.PARAMETER KeyVaultAccessToken
    A bearer token for https://vault.azure.net, needed only when one cannot be derived from
    the Graph credential - with -AccessToken, or -Interactive without a signed-in Azure
    session.
.PARAMETER BlueprintManagedIdentityPrincipalId
    Principal id of a managed identity to federate to the blueprint, so the agent can get
    tokens with no stored secret.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityTag
    Tags applied to the agent identity.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityCustomSecurityAttribute
    Custom security attributes assigned to the agent identity. Either a list of
    "AttributeSet:Attribute:Value" strings, which is the easiest form to type:

        -AgentIdentityCustomSecurityAttribute "AgentAttributes:AgentEnvironment:Production",
                                              "AgentAttributes:AgentBusinessUnit:HR",
                                              "AgentAttributes:AgentApprovalStatus:New,In_Review"

    Commas separate the values of a multi-valued attribute, and only the first two colons separate,
    so a value may itself contain colons. Whether a single value means 'New' or @('New') is decided
    from the attribute's own definition. An empty value removes the assignment.

    Or a nested hashtable of attribute set -> attribute name -> value, which is the escape hatch for
    a value that itself contains a comma:

        -AgentIdentityCustomSecurityAttribute @{
            AgentAttributes = @{
                AgentEnvironment    = 'Production'
                AgentBusinessUnit   = 'HR'
                AgentApprovalStatus = @('New','In_Review')
            }
        }

    Several attributes across several sets can be assigned at once, and both forms may be mixed.
    The request is validated against the tenant's attribute definitions before anything is created,
    because set names, attribute names and predefined values are all case-sensitive in Graph and a
    mismatch is otherwise reported as "Custom Security attributes not found on tenant".

    Needs CustomSecAttributeAssignment.ReadWrite.All and CustomSecAttributeDefinition.Read.All,
    which no other directory permission implies. See -AgentIdentitySkipCustomSecurityAttributeValidation.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentitySkipCustomSecurityAttributeValidation
    Assign -AgentIdentityCustomSecurityAttribute without first reading the tenant's attribute
    definitions. Use when the caller may assign attributes but not read their definitions.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityRequiredPermission
    Permissions granted directly on the agent identity itself, in the same hashtable shape as
    -BlueprintRequiredPermission.

    Rarely needed. Permissions normally reach an agent identity by INHERITANCE from its
    blueprint (-BlueprintRequiredPermission plus -BlueprintGrantAdminConsent). Use this only
    to give one identity something its blueprint does not confer on all of them.

    Has no effect unless -AgentIdentityGrantAdminConsent is also given.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityGrantAdminConsent
    Consent -AgentIdentityRequiredPermission on the agent identity's own service principal.

    This is NOT the same operation as -BlueprintGrantAdminConsent, which consents the
    BLUEPRINT's declared permissions and turns on inheritance for every identity beneath it.
    The two were a single switch in earlier versions of this script, which meant an
    identity-only run silently forwarded a blueprint-shaped intent to the identity step. They
    are now separate so each does exactly what its name says.

.PARAMETER BlueprintParameter
    Hashtable splatted into New-A365AgentBlueprint.ps1, for parameters this script does not
    surface (-ExposedScopeValue, -IdentifierUri, ...). Applied last, so it wins over the
    dedicated parameters on a collision.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityParameter
    Hashtable splatted into New-A365AgentIdentity.ps1.

.PARAMETER AgentRegistrationParameter
    Hashtable splatted into New-A365AgentRegistration.ps1 (-Api, -ClientAppId, -Force, ...).

.PARAMETER AgentUserPrincipalName
    UPN for the agent user, e.g. research.assistant@contoso.com. Mandatory when
    -NewAgentUser is used; the step script has no fallback and rejects an invalid UPN.

    The agent user is always created UNDER an agent identity, which the pipeline supplies
    automatically - either the one it just created or -UseExistingAgentIdentity. It is
    forwarded to the step script as its -AgentIdentityId, the service principal OBJECT ID,
    and lands in the create call as identityParentId.

    -NewAgentUser requires app-only authentication: New-A365AgentUser.ps1 is
    client-credentials only and has no -Interactive mode, so the combination is rejected up
    front rather than failing after the earlier phases have run.

.PARAMETER AgentUserDisplayName
    Display name for the agent user. Optional: when omitted, New-A365AgentUser.ps1 defaults
    it to the local part of -AgentUserPrincipalName.

.PARAMETER AgentUserMailNickname
    Mail nickname. Defaults to the local part of the UPN.

.PARAMETER AgentUserManagerUserId
    Object id of the user to set as the agent user's manager. The step script also accepts a
    UPN or mail address here. Mutually exclusive with -AgentUserManagerUpn.

.PARAMETER AgentUserManagerUpn
    UPN or mail address of the agent user's manager, resolved to an object id by the step
    script. Mutually exclusive with -AgentUserManagerUserId.

    An unresolvable manager fails before the agent user is created. A manager that resolves
    but cannot be assigned does NOT fail the step - the step script warns and reports
    ManagerAssigned = false - so this script marks the phase 'Partial' rather than letting a
    half-configured agent user report as a clean success.

.PARAMETER AgentUserUsageLocation
    Two-letter usage location for the agent user, e.g. 'US'. Required before any licence can
    be assigned; the step script defaults it to 'US'.

.PARAMETER AgentUserAssignLicense
    Assigns a licence to the agent user. Needs -AgentUserUsageLocation, and either
    -AgentUserLicenseSkuId or -AgentUserLicenseSkuPartNumber.

.PARAMETER AgentUserLicenseSkuId
    SKU id of the licence to assign to the agent user.

.PARAMETER AgentUserLicenseSkuPartNumber
    SKU part number of the licence to assign, resolved to a SKU id by the step script.

.PARAMETER AgentUserParameter
    Hashtable splatted into New-A365AgentUser.ps1, for parameters this script does not
    surface (-DisabledPlans, -ConfigurePermissions, -MaxRetries, ...). Keys are the STEP
    SCRIPT's parameter names, so they carry no AgentUser prefix.

.PARAMETER ScriptRoot
    Folder holding the step scripts. Defaults to this script's own folder.

.PARAMETER OutputJsonPath
    Writes a full run report as JSON, broken down phase by phase.

    The file contains a "phases" array with one entry per phase (Blueprint, AgentIdentity,
    Registration). Each entry records the script that ran, its status, start/end timestamps and
    duration, the parameters it was called with, every identifier it produced, the step script's
    complete return object, and - for a failed phase - the error message and the Graph status
    code when one could be parsed. Alongside it are "run" (tenant, auth mode, host, invocation),
    "summary" (the identifiers you usually want, plus the token request template) and "warnings".

    Secrets are REDACTED unless -IncludeBlueprintSecretsInOutput is also given. Metadata about a created client
    secret - its keyId, hint, and expiry - is always written, because it identifies the
    credential without disclosing it.

.PARAMETER IncludeBlueprintSecretsInOutput
    Writes the blueprint client secret created by -BlueprintNewClientSecret into
    -OutputJsonPath in
    plaintext. Off by default: a report file is easy to commit, sync or forward by accident, and
    Graph only ever returns this value once.

    The credentials used to AUTHENTICATE this run (-ClientSecret, -CertificatePassword,
    -AccessToken) are redacted even with this switch. They are already known to whoever started
    the run, and they are usually far longer-lived than the secret being reported.

    On Windows the report file is created with an ACL granting only the current user when this
    switch is used. Treat the file as a credential.

.PARAMETER ClientId
    Application (client) ID to authenticate as, or the client app id for -Interactive. The
    stock Microsoft Graph PowerShell app has no consent for the A365 preview scopes, so
    interactive runs generally need your own -ClientId.

.PARAMETER ClientSecret
    Client secret, as a SecureString or a plain string. Also read from
    $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET, which is preferred because it keeps the value out of shell
    history.

.PARAMETER CertificateThumbprint
    Thumbprint of a certificate in the current user's store.

.PARAMETER Certificate
    An X509Certificate2 to authenticate with.

.PARAMETER CertificatePath
    Path to a .pfx to authenticate with.

.PARAMETER CertificatePassword
    Password for -CertificatePath, as a SecureString or a plain string.

.PARAMETER UseManagedIdentity
    Authenticate with the host's managed identity.

.PARAMETER AccessToken
    A pre-acquired Graph access token, as a SecureString or a plain string.

.PARAMETER Interactive
    Sign in as a user.

.PARAMETER SkipPermissionCheck
    Skips each step's permission pre-flight.

.PARAMETER LogPath
    Write a timestamped, correlation-id-tagged log of this run. A path that names an
    existing directory (or ends in a separator) gets a generated file name inside it;
    anything else is used as the exact file name. Forwarded to every step script this run
    invokes, so one -LogPath produces one log per script, all sharing -LogCorrelationId.
    Omit it to log nothing.

.PARAMETER LogIncludeSecrets
    Allow plain-string client secrets and passwords in the log. SecureString values and bearer
    tokens remain redacted. Off by default; only meaningful with -LogPath.

.PARAMETER LogCorrelationId
    Correlation id written into this run's log and forwarded to every step script's log, so
    every log file produced by one run can be tied together. Generated automatically when
    omitted.

.EXAMPLE
    # The whole pipeline, interactive. Each object is named where it is created.
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId contoso.onmicrosoft.com `
        -NewBlueprint -NewAgentIdentity -NewAgentRegistration `
        -BlueprintDisplayName 'Expense Helper Blueprint' -BlueprintSponsor ana@contoso.com `
        -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Expense Helper Identity' -AgentIdentitySponsor ana@contoso.com `
        -Interactive -ClientId <your-app-id>

    The registration inherits -AgentIdentityDisplayName, so it needs no name of its own.

.EXAMPLE
    # A blueprint on its own, with a specific permission set declared, consented and made
    # inheritable.
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId contoso.onmicrosoft.com `
        -NewBlueprint -BlueprintDisplayName 'Weather MCP Blueprint' `
        -BlueprintSponsor ana@contoso.com `
        -ClientId <automation-app-id> -ClientSecret $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET `
        -BlueprintGrantAdminConsent `
        -BlueprintRequiredPermission @(
            @{  # Agent 365 observability
                ResourceAppId   = '9b975845-388f-4429-889e-eab1ef63949c'
                DelegatedScopes = @('Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite')
                AppRoles        = @('Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite')
            },
            @{  # Power Platform API
                ResourceAppId   = '8578e004-a5c6-46e7-913e-12f58912df43'
                DelegatedScopes = @('Connectivity.Connections.Read')
                AppRoles        = @()
            }
        )

    -BlueprintRequiredPermission REPLACES the blueprint script's defaults. Omit it to keep them.

.EXAMPLE
    # Unattended blueprint and identity, interactive only for the registry step.
    $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET = '<secret>'
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId contoso.onmicrosoft.com `
        -NewBlueprint -NewAgentIdentity -NewAgentRegistration `
        -BlueprintDisplayName 'Expense Helper Blueprint' `
        -BlueprintSponsor ana@contoso.com -BlueprintOwner bob@contoso.com `
        -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Expense Helper Identity' `
        -AgentIdentitySponsor ana@contoso.com -AgentIdentityOwner bob@contoso.com `
        -AgentRegistrationOwner bob@contoso.com `
        -ClientId <automation-app-id> `
        -BlueprintManagedIdentityPrincipalId <mi-principal-id> -BlueprintGrantAdminConsent `
        -AgentRegistrationAuth Interactive -OutputJsonPath .\expense-helper.json

    An owner is given to each object that should have one. Nothing fans out implicitly.

.EXAMPLE
    # Add a second agent identity to an existing blueprint, and register it.
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId contoso.onmicrosoft.com `
        -NewAgentIdentity -NewAgentRegistration `
        -UseExistingBlueprint <existing-blueprint-appId> `
        -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Expense Helper EU Identity' `
        -AgentIdentitySponsor ana@contoso.com -Interactive

.EXAMPLE
    # See the plan without writing anything.
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId contoso.onmicrosoft.com `
        -NewBlueprint -NewAgentIdentity -NewAgentRegistration `
        -BlueprintDisplayName 'Expense Helper Blueprint' -BlueprintSponsor ana@contoso.com `
        -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Expense Helper Identity' -AgentIdentitySponsor ana@contoso.com `
        -Interactive -WhatIf

.EXAMPLE
    # Full run captured to a phase-by-phase JSON report, including the client secret.
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId contoso.onmicrosoft.com `
        -NewBlueprint -NewAgentIdentity -NewAgentRegistration `
        -BlueprintDisplayName 'Expense Helper Blueprint' `
        -BlueprintSponsor ana@contoso.com -BlueprintOwner bob@contoso.com `
        -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Expense Helper Identity' `
        -AgentIdentitySponsor ana@contoso.com -AgentIdentityOwner bob@contoso.com `
        -ClientId <automation-app-id> `
        -ClientSecret $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET -BlueprintNewClientSecret -BlueprintGrantAdminConsent `
        -OutputJsonPath .\expense-helper-run.json -IncludeBlueprintSecretsInOutput

    # Then read individual phases back out:
    $report = Get-Content .\expense-helper-run.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
    $report.phases | Format-Table phase, name, status, durationSeconds
    $report.phases.Where{ $_.name -eq 'Blueprint' }.secrets.clientSecret
    $report.summary.identifiers

.EXAMPLE
    # A report is still written when a phase fails, so the objects created before the failure
    # are not lost. Inspect the failing phase:
    $report = Get-Content .\expense-helper-run.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
    $report.phases | Where-Object status -eq 'Failed' |
        Select-Object name, @{n='http';e={$_.error.httpStatus}}, @{n='code';e={$_.error.graphErrorCode}}

.EXAMPLE
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId $tid `
        -NewBlueprint -NewAgentIdentity -NewAgentRegistration -NewAgentUser `
        -ClientId $appId -ClientSecret $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET `
        -BlueprintDisplayName 'Research Assistant Blueprint' `
        -BlueprintSponsor alice@contoso.com -BlueprintOwner alice@contoso.com `
        -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Research Assistant Identity' `
        -AgentIdentitySponsor alice@contoso.com -AgentIdentityOwner alice@contoso.com `
        -AgentRegistrationOwner alice@contoso.com `
        -AgentUserPrincipalName research.assistant@contoso.com `
        -AgentUserManagerUpn alice@contoso.com `
        -AgentUserUsageLocation US -AgentUserAssignLicense `
        -AgentUserLicenseSkuPartNumber Microsoft_365_Copilot

    All four scenarios. -NewAgentUser needs app-only auth, because New-A365AgentUser.ps1
    is client-credentials only.

    Note there is no identity parameter here: the agent user is bound to the agent identity
    this run creates, which the pipeline forwards automatically.

.EXAMPLE
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId $tid `
        -NewAgentUser -UseExistingAgentIdentity $identityId `
        -ClientId $appId -ClientSecret $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET `
        -AgentUserPrincipalName research.assistant@contoso.com

    The agent user on its own, against an agent identity that already exists.
    -UseExistingAgentIdentity is the service principal object id of the agent identity.

.EXAMPLE
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId $tid `
        -ClientId $appId -ClientSecret $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET `
        -UpdateAgentIdentity $identityId `
        -AgentIdentityCustomSecurityAttribute 'AgentAttributes:AgentApprovalStatus:HR_Approved,IT_Approved'

    Change one custom security attribute on an existing agent identity and nothing else. The
    display name, tags, sponsors and owners are not passed, so they are not written.

.EXAMPLE
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId $tid `
        -ClientId $appId -ClientSecret $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET `
        -UpdateBlueprint $blueprintAppId `
        -BlueprintDescription 'Weather MCP blueprint - production'

    Rewrite only the blueprint description. -BlueprintDisplayName is left out, so the name is
    untouched.

.EXAMPLE
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId $tid `
        -ClientId $appId -ClientSecret $env:A365_CLIENT_SECRET `
        -UpdateBlueprint    $blueprintAppId -BlueprintDescription 'Q3 refresh' `
        -UpdateAgentIdentity $identityId  -AgentIdentityTag 'env:prod','team:hr' `
        -UpdateAgentRegistration $registrationId -AgentRegistrationDisplayName 'HR Agent'

    Several updates in one run. Each phase targets its own object and writes only the
    attributes named for it. -AgentIdentityTag adds the requested tags without removing the
    identity's existing non-inherited tags.

.EXAMPLE
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId $tid -Interactive `
        -RemoveAgentRegistration $regId -RemoveAgentIdentity $identityId `
        -RemoveInspectOnly

    Report everything those two removals would delete, and delete nothing. Always the first
    command to run before a removal.

.EXAMPLE
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId $tid -Interactive `
        -RemoveAgentRegistration $regId -RemoveAgentUser $agentUserId `
        -RemoveAgentIdentity $identityId -RemoveForce

    Retire one agent completely: its registry entry, its agent user and its agent identity.
    Name each object explicitly - one -Remove* switch per object, each handled by its own script.
    The objects are soft-deleted and restorable for 30 days; add -RemovePermanent to purge.

.EXAMPLE
    .\A365-AutomationOrchestrator.ps1 -TenantId $tid -Interactive `
        -RemoveBlueprint $blueprintAppId -RemoveForce

    Delete a blueprint together with every agent identity and agent user built from it.
    Without -RemoveForce this is refused while any identity still exists.

.NOTES
    MIGRATING FROM 2.0.0 AND EARLIER

    The -UseExisting* parameters were removed in 3.0.0 and the -Create* switches were renamed
    to -New*. As of 3.1.0 the -Create* spellings no longer bind at all. -UseExisting* meant two
    different things depending on where it appeared, so it maps to more than one replacement:

        old                          new
        -CreateBlueprint             -NewBlueprint
        -CreateAgentIdentity         -NewAgentIdentity
        -CreateAgentUser             -NewAgentUser
        -CreateAgentRegistration     -NewAgentRegistration

        -UpdateBlueprint -UseExistingBlueprint <id>
                                     -UpdateBlueprint <id>
        -UpdateAgentIdentity -UseExistingAgentIdentity <id>
                                     -UpdateAgentIdentity <id>
        -UpdateAgentUser -UseExistingAgentUser <id>
                                     -UpdateAgentUser <id>
        -UpdateRegistration -UseExistingRegistration <id>
                                     -UpdateAgentRegistration <id>   (-UpdateRegistration kept as alias)

        -CreateAgentIdentity -UseExistingBlueprint <appId>
                                     -NewAgentIdentity -UseExistingBlueprint <appId>
        -CreateAgentUser -UseExistingAgentIdentity <id>
                                     -NewAgentUser -UseExistingAgentIdentity <id>
        -CreateAgentRegistration -UseExistingAgentIdentity <id>
                                     -NewAgentRegistration -UseExistingAgentIdentity <id>

    A saved command line that still passes -UseExisting* fails with PowerShell's "a parameter
    cannot be found" error; the table above says what to put in its place.

    The registration phase targets POST /beta/copilot/agentRegistrations, which is what the
    a365 CLI actually calls. It is preview surface, absent from the public Graph docs, and
    may require tenant enrolment.

    New-A365AgentUser.ps1 reports failure by exiting with a non-zero code rather than
    throwing. This script checks $LASTEXITCODE for that reason - a try/catch alone never
    fires.

    That script also reports the manager and the licence in its result object instead of
    failing, so an agent user can be created with neither attached. The phase is marked
    'Partial' and the run reports 'Incomplete', rather than calling it a success.

    To provision many agents from one CSV file instead of one at a time, see
    A365-BulkOnboarding.ps1, which drives this orchestrator once per row in
    dependency order.

# One log file per RUN, never appended to by another run: the name carries the date and

Nothing was selected. Choose at least one action.

Create:
  -NewBlueprint              create a blueprint application and its principal
  -NewAgentIdentity          create an agent identity
  -NewAgentUser              create the agent user
  -NewAgentRegistration      register it in the registry

Update (takes the id of the object to change; only the attributes you pass are written):
  -UpdateBlueprint         <blueprint appId or objectId>
  -UpdateAgentIdentity     <agent identity objectId>
  -UpdateAgentUser         <agent user objectId or UPN>
  -UpdateAgentRegistration <registration id, starts with T_>

When a create needs a parent that already exists, name it:
  -UseExistingBlueprint    <blueprint appId>   for -NewAgentIdentity
  -UseExistingAgentIdentity         <identity objectId> for -NewAgentUser
  -UseExistingAgentIdentity   <identity objectId> for -NewAgentUser and/or -NewAgentRegistration

Or delete something (DESTRUCTIVE; add -RemoveInspectOnly to see the plan first):
