<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a Microsoft Agent 365 Agent User (and optionally an Agent Identity) using only
    Microsoft Graph REST API calls, authenticating app-only (application permissions).

.DESCRIPTION
    Replicates the Graph API calls the Agent 365 CLI ("a365 setup createinstance") performs,
    without any dependency on the CLI, the Microsoft.Graph PowerShell SDK, or Azure CLI.

    Two mutually exclusive target modes:

      -AgentIdentityId <spObjectId>   Use an EXISTING Agent Identity. The script only creates
                                      the Agent User bound to it.

      -BlueprintAppId <appId>         Create a NEW Agent Identity from the Agent Blueprint,
                                      then create the Agent User bound to the new identity.

    Licensing is opt-in: no license is assigned unless -AssignLicense is specified.

    Authentication is application-only (client credentials). Supported methods:
      1.  Client secret                      -ClientSecret
      2.  Certificate from cert store        -CertificateThumbprint [-CertificateStoreLocation]
      3.  Certificate from PFX file          -CertificatePath [-CertificatePassword]
      4.  Certificate object                 -Certificate
      5.  Managed identity (system-assigned) -UseManagedIdentity
      6.  Managed identity (user-assigned)   -UseManagedIdentity -ManagedIdentityClientId
      7.  Workload identity federation       -FederatedTokenFile  (AKS / Kubernetes)
      8.  Federated client assertion         -ClientAssertion     (GitHub OIDC, any OIDC IdP)
      9.  Azure CLI service principal token  -UseAzureCli
      10. Azure PowerShell (Az) token        -UseAzPowerShell
      11. Pre-acquired raw token             -AccessToken

    When no auth parameter is supplied, the script auto-detects, in order: AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH, AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE, GitHub Actions OIDC, then IMDS
    managed identity. This makes the script drop-in compatible with standard Azure SDK
    environment-variable conventions.

.PARAMETER TenantId
    Directory (tenant) ID or verified domain. Required for client secret, certificate and
    federated-credential auth; optional for -AccessToken (read from the token's 'tid'
    claim), managed identity, -UseAzureCli and -UseAzPowerShell.

.PARAMETER ClientId
    Application (client) ID authenticating to Graph. Required for client secret, certificate,
    federated token, client assertion, and GitHub OIDC authentication. Managed identity,
    Azure CLI, Az PowerShell, and access-token authentication do not require it.

.PARAMETER ClientSecret
    Client secret, as a SecureString or a plain string. Auto-detected from
    $env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET when no auth parameter is supplied. Exactly one authentication
    method may be given.

.PARAMETER CertificateThumbprint
    Thumbprint of a certificate in the -CertificateStoreLocation store's "My" folder.

.PARAMETER CertificateStoreLocation
    Store to read -CertificateThumbprint from: 'CurrentUser' (default) or 'LocalMachine'.

.PARAMETER CertificatePath
    Path to a .pfx file to authenticate with. Combine with -CertificatePassword when the
    file is protected. Auto-detected from $env:AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH.

.PARAMETER CertificatePassword
    Password for -CertificatePath, as a SecureString or a plain string.

.PARAMETER Certificate
    An already-loaded X509Certificate2 to authenticate with.

.PARAMETER UseManagedIdentity
    Authenticate with the host's managed identity (system-assigned, or user-assigned with
    -ManagedIdentityClientId). Supports the App Service/Container Apps/Functions
    IDENTITY_ENDPOINT protocol and Azure VM/VMSS IMDS.

.PARAMETER ManagedIdentityClientId
    Client id of a user-assigned managed identity, used with -UseManagedIdentity.

.PARAMETER FederatedTokenFile
    Path to a workload-identity federation token file (AKS/Kubernetes), exchanged for a
    Graph token via client assertion. Auto-detected from $env:AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE.

.PARAMETER ClientAssertion
    A pre-built JWT client assertion (e.g. from a GitHub OIDC or other OIDC identity
    provider) to authenticate -ClientId with.

.PARAMETER UseAzureCli
    Obtain a Graph token from the signed-in Azure CLI ('az account get-access-token').

.PARAMETER UseAzPowerShell
    Obtain a Graph token from the signed-in Az PowerShell session (Get-AzAccessToken).

.PARAMETER AccessToken
    A pre-acquired Microsoft Graph access token, as a SecureString or a plain string.

.PARAMETER Environment
    Azure cloud: 'AzurePublic' (default), 'AzureUSGovernment' or 'AzureChina'. Selects the
    default Graph and authority endpoints; override either individually with -GraphBaseUrl
    or -AuthorityHost.

.PARAMETER GraphBaseUrl
    Overrides the Microsoft Graph base URL implied by -Environment.

.PARAMETER AuthorityHost
    Overrides the Microsoft Entra authority host implied by -Environment.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityId
    Object id (service principal id) of an EXISTING agent identity to create the agent user
    under. Mutually exclusive with -BlueprintAppId; one of the two is required unless
    -ConfigurePermissions or -Update is used alone.

.PARAMETER BlueprintAppId
    AppId (or object id - they are the same GUID for a blueprint) of the blueprint to mint a
    NEW agent identity from before creating the agent user. Mutually exclusive with
    -AgentIdentityId.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityDisplayName
    Display name for the new agent identity. Required with -BlueprintAppId.

.PARAMETER ConfigurePermissions
    Configures the Entra application registration with every Graph application permission this
    script requires: adds them to the app manifest (requiredResourceAccess) and creates the
    corresponding appRoleAssignments (tenant admin consent) on the app's service principal.

    Permissions are organised into capability groups. Within each group the roles are ordered
    from least to most privileged, and the script grants the first one the tenant's Microsoft
    Graph service principal actually exposes:

      AgentIdentityCreate  AgentIdentity.Create.All | .CreateAsManager | .ReadWrite.All
      AgentIdentityRead    AgentIdentity.Read.All | .ReadWrite.All | Application.Read.All
      AgentUserWrite       AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All | .IdentityParentedBy | User.ReadWrite.All
      UserWrite            User.ReadWrite.All
      LicenseAssign        LicenseAssignment.ReadWrite.All | AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All | User.ReadWrite.All
      SubscribedSkuRead    Organization.Read.All | Directory.Read.All
      DirectoryRead        User.Read.All | Directory.Read.All
      BlueprintAccess      Application.ReadWrite.All | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
                           (this group gates agent identity creation: ReadWrite.All allows ANY
                            blueprint, ReadWrite.OwnedBy only blueprints the app owns)

    One further group is OPT-IN and is skipped unless you ask for it:

      AgentIdentityOwnerWrite  AgentIdentity.ReadWrite.All   (-IncludeOwnerWritePermission)
                           Only needed to add NON-USER owners (e.g. a service principal) to an
                           agent identity after it has been created. User owners are bound inline
                           during creation and need nothing extra.

    The credential used for this step must itself hold Application.ReadWrite.All AND
    AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, and be Application Administrator, Cloud Application
    Administrator or Global Administrator. Run it once with an elevated credential, then run the
    agent-user creation with the configured app.

    If -ConfigurePermissions is supplied WITHOUT -AgentIdentityId or -BlueprintAppId, the script
    only configures permissions and exits.

.PARAMETER GrantAllAlternatives
    Grant every resolvable role in each capability group rather than only the least privileged
    one. Useful when you want the app to keep working as beta roles change.

.PARAMETER IncludeBootstrapRoles
    Additionally grant AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All so the configured application can run
    -ConfigurePermissions itself later. Highly privileged, therefore opt-in.

.PARAMETER IncludeOwnerWritePermission
    Additionally grant AgentIdentity.ReadWrite.All, which is what Microsoft Graph actually
    requires to add an owner to an agent identity AFTER it has been created.

    You only need this to set a NON-USER owner (typically a service principal). Directory users
    are bound inline in the creation request itself and require no extra permission.

    Opt-in because AgentIdentity.ReadWrite.All also grants update and delete over every agent
    identity in the tenant.

    Note: Application.ReadWrite.All does NOT cover this - an agentIdentity is a protected
    servicePrincipal subtype and returns 403. Adding Directory.Read.All does not help either,
    despite what the generic "servicePrincipal: Add owner" documentation implies.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityOwnerId
    Object IDs of the directory users to set as owners of a NEWLY created agent identity.
    Accepts multiple values. Ignored on the -AgentIdentityId path, which reuses an existing
    identity.

.PARAMETER AgentIdentityOwnerUpn
    Same as -AgentIdentityOwnerId but accepts user principal names / mail addresses, which are
    resolved to object IDs. Combine freely with -AgentIdentityOwnerId.

.PARAMETER NoDefaultOwner
    Suppresses the default behaviour of making the sponsor an owner of a newly created agent
    identity, leaving it with no owner unless -AgentIdentityOwnerId/-AgentIdentityOwnerUpn is
    given.

.PARAMETER AddClientAsBlueprintOwner
    Adds the calling application's service principal as an owner of the blueprint application
    before creating the agent identity.

    Only needed when the app holds Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy instead of
    Application.ReadWrite.All, since that permission restricts it to blueprints it owns. Adding
    the owner itself requires Application.ReadWrite.All or an existing owner/administrator.

.PARAMETER NoOwnershipSelfHeal
    Disables the automatic take-ownership-and-retry recovery that runs when creation is rejected
    with "Request principal is not the owner". Use it to keep provisioning strictly read-only with
    respect to the blueprint's owner list.

.PARAMETER UserPrincipalName
    UPN for the agent user, e.g. research.assistant@contoso.com. Required when creating (not
    with -Update, which is identified by -AgentUserId or this same parameter and cannot
    rename the UPN afterwards).

.PARAMETER DisplayName
    Display name for the agent user. When omitted on create, defaults to the local part of
    -UserPrincipalName. Under -Update, sent only when explicitly passed.

.PARAMETER MailNickname
    Mail nickname. When omitted on create, defaults to the local part of -UserPrincipalName.
    Under -Update, sent only when explicitly passed.

.PARAMETER UsageLocation
    Two-letter usage location for the agent user, e.g. 'US'. Defaults to 'US' on create and
    is required before a licence can be assigned. Under -Update it is sent ONLY when
    explicitly passed, so re-running an update never silently overwrites it.

.PARAMETER SponsorUserId
    Object id of the user to set as sponsor of a newly created agent identity. Mutually
    exclusive in effect with -SponsorUpn (this one wins if both are given). Required by
    Graph on the -BlueprintAppId path.

.PARAMETER SponsorUpn
    UPN or mail address of the sponsor, resolved to an object id. Used when -SponsorUserId is
    not given.

.PARAMETER ManagerUserId
    Object id of the user to set as the agent user's manager. Takes precedence over
    -ManagerUpn when both are given.

.PARAMETER ManagerUpn
    UPN or mail address of the manager, resolved to an object id. Used when -ManagerUserId is
    not given.

.PARAMETER AssignLicense
    Assigns a licence to the agent user. Off by default (opt-in). Needs -UsageLocation and
    either -LicenseSkuId or -LicenseSkuPartNumber.

.PARAMETER LicenseSkuId
    SKU id of the licence to assign. Defaults to the Microsoft Agent 365 Tier 3 SKU
    (304b93a3-b1f1-427f-aa02-da21e7c7d675). Overridden by -LicenseSkuPartNumber when given.

.PARAMETER LicenseSkuPartNumber
    SKU part number of the licence to assign; resolved to a SKU id against the tenant's
    subscribed SKUs and takes precedence over -LicenseSkuId.

.PARAMETER DisabledPlans
    Service plan ids to disable within the assigned licence.

.PARAMETER ConfigureAppId
    With -ConfigurePermissions, the application to configure. Defaults to -ClientId; use this
    to configure a different app than the one authenticating this run.

.PARAMETER MaxRetries
    Maximum retry attempts for a transient (429/5xx) Graph failure. Default 8.

.PARAMETER RetryDelaySeconds
    Base delay, in seconds, between retries of a transient Graph failure. Default 5.

.PARAMETER PassThru
    Return a result object describing what was created/changed. Without it the script writes
    console output only and returns nothing.

.PARAMETER Update
    Update an agent user that already exists instead of creating one. Requires -AgentUserId.

    Only the attributes supplied on the command line are written. This matters here more than
    elsewhere: -UsageLocation defaults to US and -DisplayName is derived from the user
    principal name, so writing "whatever the variable holds" would silently rewrite a live
    account. Both are sent only when explicitly passed.

    The update refuses to touch an account that is not an agent user, so an ordinary
    employee's account cannot be modified by mistake.

    Update-A365AgentUser.ps1 is the dedicated entry point for this and is usually the clearer
    way to call it. Both run exactly the same code.

.PARAMETER AgentUserId
    With -Update, the object id or user principal name of the agent user to change. The user
    principal name itself cannot be changed after creation.

.PARAMETER LogPath
    Write a timestamped log of this run. A path that names an existing directory (or ends in
    a separator) gets a generated file name inside it; anything else is used as the exact
    file name. Omit it to log nothing.

.PARAMETER LogIncludeSecrets
    Allow plain-string client secrets and passwords in the log. SecureString values and bearer
    tokens remain redacted. Only meaningful with -LogPath.

.PARAMETER LogCorrelationId
    Correlation id written into the log, shared with any calling script's own log so a run can
    be traced across scripts. Generated automatically when omitted.

.EXAMPLE
    # One-time: grant the app the permissions it needs (elevated credential required)
    .\New-A365AgentUser.ps1 -TenantId $tid -ClientId $cid -ClientSecret $sec -ConfigurePermissions

.EXAMPLE
    # Existing Agent Identity, no license
    .\New-A365AgentUser.ps1 -TenantId $tid -ClientId $cid -ClientSecret $sec `
        -AgentIdentityId '8f1c...' -UserPrincipalName 'aria@contoso.com' -DisplayName 'Aria'

.EXAMPLE
    # New Agent Identity from a blueprint, with a license and a manager.
    # NOTE: -ClientId is the MANAGEMENT app doing the work; -BlueprintAppId is only the blueprint
    # the new identity is minted from. They are deliberately different applications.
    .\New-A365AgentUser.ps1 -TenantId $tid -ClientId $cid -CertificateThumbprint $thumb `
        -BlueprintAppId $blueprintAppId -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Aria Identity' `
        -UserPrincipalName 'aria@contoso.com' -DisplayName 'Aria' -UsageLocation 'US' `
        -SponsorUpn 'owner@contoso.com' -ManagerUpn 'manager@contoso.com' -AssignLicense

.EXAMPLE
    # Give the new agent identity explicit owners instead of defaulting to the sponsor
    .\New-A365AgentUser.ps1 -TenantId $tid -ClientId $cid -ClientSecret $sec `
        -BlueprintAppId $blueprintAppId -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Aria Identity' `
        -SponsorUpn 'sponsor@contoso.com' `
        -AgentIdentityOwnerUpn 'owner1@contoso.com','owner2@contoso.com' `
        -UserPrincipalName 'aria@contoso.com' -DisplayName 'Aria'

.EXAMPLE
    # Blueprint path where the app only holds Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, so it must own the
    # blueprint it mints identities from
    .\New-A365AgentUser.ps1 -TenantId $tid -ClientId $cid -ClientSecret $sec `
        -BlueprintAppId $blueprintAppId -AddClientAsBlueprintOwner `
        -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Aria Identity' -SponsorUpn 'owner@contoso.com' `
        -UserPrincipalName 'aria@contoso.com' -DisplayName 'Aria'

.EXAMPLE
    # Workload identity federation inside AKS, US Government cloud
    .\New-A365AgentUser.ps1 -TenantId $tid -ClientId $cid -FederatedTokenFile $env:AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE `
        -Environment AzureUSGovernment -BlueprintAppId $bp -AgentIdentityDisplayName 'Aria Identity' `
        -UserPrincipalName 'aria@contoso.us' -DisplayName 'Aria'

.NOTES
    The calling application (-ClientId) is always the identity that authenticates to Graph. For
    the -BlueprintAppId path the blueprint is only DATA in the request body: the blueprint's own
    credentials are never needed.

    IMPORTANT - which Application.* permission the calling app holds decides whether blueprints
    have to be owned:

      Application.ReadWrite.All      Any blueprint in the tenant may be used. Nothing else needed.
                                     This is the simplest configuration and the default choice of
                                     -ConfigurePermissions.

      Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy  Only blueprints the calling app OWNS may be used. Any other
                                     blueprint fails with HTTP 403 "Request principal is not the
                                     owner", even when AgentIdentity.Create.All is granted. Pair
                                     it with -AddClientAsBlueprintOwner, or let the script take
                                     ownership automatically and retry.

    An agentIdentityBlueprint is a subtype of application whose object id and appId are the SAME
    GUID, so -BlueprintAppId accepts either interchangeably.

    Microsoft documents a sponsor reference as required when creating an agent identity, so pass
    -SponsorUpn or -SponsorUserId on the blueprint path.

    OWNERS OF THE NEW AGENT IDENTITY
    The Agent 365 CLI makes the signed-in user both the sponsor and an owner of each agent
    identity it creates, binding 'owners@odata.bind' in the same POST. This script is app-only and
    has no signed-in user, so the sponsor is used as the default owner. Override with
    -AgentIdentityOwnerUpn/-AgentIdentityOwnerId, or opt out with -NoDefaultOwner.

    Owners that are directory USERS are bound inline in the creation request itself and need no
    extra permission - this is the normal path and is what the CLI does. Anything else (e.g. a
    service principal) cannot be bound inline and must be added afterwards via
    POST /beta/servicePrincipals/{id}/owners/$ref, which requires AgentIdentity.ReadWrite.All
    (grant it with -ConfigurePermissions -IncludeOwnerWritePermission). Application.ReadWrite.All
    is NOT sufficient for that call.

    AgentIdentity.* and AgentIdUser.* are Agent 365 beta permissions. They are granted here as
    normal application appRoleAssignments. Beware: pressing "Grant admin consent" in the Entra
    portal afterwards can silently drop beta DELEGATED scopes, though application role
    assignments created by this script are unaffected.

     That app needs Application.ReadWrite.All AND AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, admin-consented.

  3. One-time manual consent in the Entra portal for app $AppId, then re-run app-only:
       Entra ID > App registrations > $AppId > API permissions > Add a permission >
       Microsoft Graph > Application permissions, then "Grant admin consent".
